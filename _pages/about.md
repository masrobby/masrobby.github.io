I am a Ph.D. student at the [Radio Cosmology Research Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/view/radiocosmologylaboratory/home), Universiti Malaya, Malaysia. My research interest lies in various fields of astronomy and astrophysics, including high-mass star formation, high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs), galaxy clusters and filaments, and fast radio bursts (FRBs).

I am currently working on maser emissions from high-mass star-forming regions to understand their accretion-outflow processes, primarily using data from the KVN and VERA Array (KaVA) under the [star formation group](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/understanding-highmass-star-formation-through-kava-observations-of-water-and-methanol-masers/19BE34287FA23B816425F5D6AF6CB487). I am also a part of the [Radio Galaxy Environment Survey (RAGERS)](https://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/science/large-programs/ragers/) team, looking into protoclusters and high-redshift radio galaxies in submillimeter.

I am also a Python programming enthusiast and a LaTeX aficionado. I love building PCs and am currently learning to setup storage and computation servers. On the side, I enjoy playing the guitar, solving Rubik's cubes, and playing FPS games.
